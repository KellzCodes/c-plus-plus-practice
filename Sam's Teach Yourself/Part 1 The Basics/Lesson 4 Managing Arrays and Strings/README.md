# Lesson 4: Managing Arrays and Strings

- [What is an Array?](#What-is-an-Array)
- [Multidimensional Arrays](#Multidimensional-Arrays)
- [Dynamic Arrays](#Dynamic-Arrays)
- [C-style Character Strings](#C-style-Character-Strings)
- [C++ Strings: Using std::string](#C-plus-plus-Strings)

In previous lessons, you declared variables used to contain a single ```int```, ```char```, or ```string``` to mention a few instances. However, you may want to declare a collection of objects, such as 20 ```int```s or a string of characters to hold a name.
In this lesson, you learn
- What arrays are and how to declare and use them 
- What strings are and how to use character arrays to make them 
- A brief introduction to ```std::string```
