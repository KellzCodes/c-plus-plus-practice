# Part I: The Basics

## LESSON 1 Getting Started

Welcome to Sams Teach Yourself C++ in One Hour a Day! You're ready to get started on becoming a proficient C++ programmer. 

In this lesson, you find out:
- Why C++ is a standard in software development 
- How to enter, compile, and link your first working C++ program
- What's new in C++

### A Brief History of C++ 

The purpose of a programming language is to make consumption of computational resources easier. C++ is not a new language, 
yet one that is popularly adopted and continuously evolving. As of the time of writing this repo, the newest version of C++ 
ratified by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) popularly called C++17, published December 2017.

#### Connection to C

Initially developed by Bjarne Stroustroup at Bell Labs in 1979, C++ was designed to be a successor to C. In contrast to 
C, however, C++ was designed to be an object-oriented  language that implements concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, 
polymorphism, and encapsulation. C++ features classes that are used to contain member data and member methods. These 
member methods operate using member data. The effect of this organization is that the programmer models data and actions 
he wants to perform using the same. Many popular C++ compilers have continued to support C programming too.

**NOTE**: Knowledge or experience in C programming is not a prerequisite for learning C++. If your ultimate goal is to 
learn an object-oriented programming language like C++, then you don't need to start learning a procedural language like C.

#### Advantages of C++

C++ is considered an intermediate-level programming language, which means that it allows for high-level programming of 
applications as well as low-level programming of libraries that work close to the hardware. For many programmers, C++ 
provides the optimal mix of being a high-level language that lets one develop complex applications while supplying 
flexibility in allowing the developer to extract the best performance via  accurate control of resource consumption 
and availability.
