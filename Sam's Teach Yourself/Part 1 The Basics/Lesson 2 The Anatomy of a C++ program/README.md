# LESSON 2 The Anatomy of a C++ program

C++ programs are organized into classes comprising member functions 
and member variables. Most of this repo is devoted to explaining these 
parts in depth, but to get a sense of how a program fits together, you  
must see a complete working program.

In this lesson, you learn:
- The parts of a C++ program
- How the parts work together 
- What a function is and what it does
- Basic input and output operations
