# Sams Teach Yourself C++ in One Hour a Day!

## Introduction 

2011 and 2014 were two special years for C++. While C++ll ushered in a dramatic improvement to C++, introducing new keywords and constructs that increased your programming efficiency, C++14 brought in incremental improvements that added  finishing touches to the features introduced by C++11.

This book helps you learn C++ in tiny steps. It has been thoughtfully divided into lessons that teach you the fundamentals of this object-oriented programming language from a practical point of view. Depending on your proficiency level, you will be able to master C++ one hour at a time. 

Learning C++ by doing is the best wayâ€”so try the rich variety of code samples in this book hands-on and help yourself improve your programming proficiency. These code snippets have been tested using the latest versions of the available compilers at the  time of writing, namely the Microsoft Visual C++ compiler for C++ and GNU's C++ compiler, which both offer a rich coverage of C++14 features. 

## Who Should Read This Repo?

The book starts with the very basics of C++. All that is needed is a desire to learn this language and curiosity to understand how stuff works. An existing knowledge of C++ programming can be an advantage but is not a prerequisite. This is also a book you  might like to refer to if you already know C++ but want to learn additions that have been made to the language. If you are a professional programmer, Part IlI, "Learning the Standard Template Library (STL)," is bound to help you create better, more practical C++ applications.

## Organization of This Repo

Depending on your current proficiency levels with C++, you can choose the section you would like to start with. Concepts introduced by C++ll and C++14 are sprinkled throughout the book, in the relevant lessons. This book has been organized into five parts:

- **Part I: "The Basics,"** gets you started with writing simple C++ applications. In doing so, it introduces you to the keywords that you most frequently see in C++ code of a variable without compromising on type safety. 

- **Part II: "Fundamentals of Object-Oriented C++ Programming,"** teaches you the concept of classes. You learn how C++ supports the important object-oriented programming principles of encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism. Lesson 9, "Classes and Objects," teaches you the concept of move constructor  followed by the move assignment operator in Lesson 12, "Operator Types and  Operator Overloading." These performance features help reduce unwanted and unnecessary copy steps, boosting the performance of your application. Lesson 14, "An Introduction to Macros and Templates," is your stepping stone to writing powerful generic C++ code.

- **Part III, "Learning the Standard Template Library (STL),"** helps you write efficient 'i and practical C++ code using the STL ```string``` class and containers. You learn how ```std: : string``` makes simple string concatenation operations safe and easy and how you don't need to use C-style ```char*``` strings anymore. You will be able to use STL dynamic arrays and linked lists instead of programming your own.

- **Part IV, "More STL,"** focuses on algorithms. You learn to use ```sort``` on containers such as ```vector``` via iterators. In this part, you find out how keyword ```auto``` introduced by C++11 has made a significant reduction to the length of your iterator declarations. Lesson 22, "Lambda Expressions," presents a powerful new feature that results in significant code reduction when you use STL algorithms.

- **Part V, "Advanced C++ Concepts,"** explains language capabilities such as smart pointers and exception handling, which are not a must in a C++ application but help make a significant contribution toward increasing its stability and quality. This part ends with a note on best practices in writing good C++ applications, and introduces you to the new features expected to make it to the next version of the ISO standard called C++17.
