# Tic-Tac-Toe

#### Prerequisites:

1. In order to complete this project, you should have completed the following sections of [Foundations](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/tree/master/foundations):

	- [Loops](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/tree/master/foundations/3.%20Loops)
	- [Vectors](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/tree/master/foundations/7.%20Vectors)
	- [Functions](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/tree/master/foundations/8.%20Functions)

	Make sure to plan out the program on paper before you start coding and remember to take breaks!

	Youâ€™ll need to account for the following:

	- This game will have two players that will input in the same terminal.
	- This 3x3 game board will need to be represented using a data structure, like a vector or an array.
	- There are 8 winning combinations.

#### Project requirements:

2. [Loops](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/tree/master/foundations/3.%20Loops): This program should use a for loop or while loop to iterate through the player turns.

3. [Vectors](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/tree/master/foundations/7.%20Vectors): This program should use a vector or an array to hold nine positions of the 3x3 grid.

4. [Functions](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/tree/master/foundations/8.%20Functions): This program should be modular.

Example solution can be found in the [ttt.cpp](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/Tic-Tac-Toe/ttt.cpp), [play.cpp](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/Tic-Tac-Toe/play.cpp), and [play.hpp](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/Tic-Tac-Toe/play.hpp) files.
