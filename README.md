# c-plus-plus-practice
I am learning C++

This repository is my coding journal. I am learning from scratch and sharing my lessons. Hopefully, this will be a great tutorial.

## Foundations

The Foundations folder of this project contains the [introductory](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/tree/master/foundations/Introduction) lessons of C++. This folder includes a [README.md](#https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/foundations/1.%20Introduction/README.md) file that shows all the details of each lesson. In foundations, I have learned about:

- Making a basic "hello world" program
- comments
- including standard library
- main function
- curly braces
- return statements
- compiling and executing programs
- Declaring and initializing variables
- basic data types

The folder also includes basic C++ programs that demonstrate what I've learned above.

## Conditionals and Logic

Next......details coming soon
