# c-plus-plus-practice
I am learning C++

This repository is my coding journal. I am learning from scratch and sharing my lessons. Hopefully, this will be a great tutorial.

## Foundations
The Foundations folder of this project contains the [introductory](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/tree/master/foundations/Introduction) lessons of C++.
