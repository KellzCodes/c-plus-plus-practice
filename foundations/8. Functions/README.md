# Functions
#### C++ functions allow you to use the same code statements over and over without repeating yourself.

As a programmer, you will find yourself reusing the same blocks of code over and over throughout your program. In times like these, you can turn to functions.

Also known as a method or procedure, a *function* is a named group of code statements that accomplish something together, a bit like a factory machine.

There are some great reasons to use functions in your code:

- A single line can make all that code fire off instead of a whole bunch of lines.
- You can build DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) code, reusing the code you already wrote.
- Functions help make your code flexible and *modular*, meaning you can group your code more easily by task.

In fact, every C++ program has at least one function. “Hold on,” you may be thinking, “I’ve written some C++ programs, but I haven’t written any functions yet!”

Well, as it happens, ```main()``` is a function that you’ve already used! And you’ll understand it a bit more as you learn how functions work.
