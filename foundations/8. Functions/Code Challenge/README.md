# Code Challenge

Roll up your sleeves and get yourself in the mood for functions, because it’s code challenge time!

Say what? Here’s how it works:

- Each exercise in this lesson has a C++ function for you to build.
- Each challenge has many solutions and we encourage you to be creative.
- We don’t care what goes on in the function as long as it works the way it should. (Notice those tests in ```main()``` for each function.)

As a refresher, C++ function syntax looks like this:

```
return_type function_name(paramater1, parameter2) {

   // Code block here

   return output_if_there_is_any;

}
```

For example, with real code this might look like:

```
bool is_even(int number) {

  if (number % 2 == 0) {

    return true;

  }

  return false;

}
```
