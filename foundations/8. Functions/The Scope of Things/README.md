# The Scope of Things

1. Start with this code:

```
#include <iostream>

std::string secret_knowledge = "https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/foundations/8.%20Functions/The%20Scope%20of%20Things/onyourexcitingjourneylearningtocodeyouwillfindthis.gif";

void enter_code(int passcode) {
  
  if (passcode == 0310) {
    
    std::cout << secret_knowledge << "\n";
    
  } else {
    
    std::cout << "Sorry, incorrect!\n";
    
  }
}

int main() {
  
  std::cout << secret_knowledge << "\n";
  
  enter_code(0310);
  
}
```

2. If you run the code, you can print ```secret_knowledge``` right in ```main()``` without entering the passcode. Yikes!

	Only people who enter the correct passcode should have access to that knowledge.

	Move ```secret_knowledge``` into local scope so that it only prints from the function call when the correct code is entered.

3. Nice work! Now itâ€™s time to get rid of that error.

	Remove the line in ```main()``` that prints ```secret_knowledge``` directly without doing any math.

Example code can be found in the [main.cpp](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/foundations/8.%20Functions/The%20Scope%20of%20Things/main.cpp) file.
