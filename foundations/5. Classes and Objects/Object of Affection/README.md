# The Object of Your Affection

Your friend is building a new match-making service: The Object of Your Affection or OOYA for short (don’t worry, you still have time to convince them to change the name).

With your new understanding of C++ objects and classes, your friend thought you could build a pretty well-organized system of dating profiles.

Your first step? Build a ```Profile``` class that allows users to generate profile objects.

The Profile should store the following information:

- User’s name
- User’s age
- User’s city
- User’s country
- User’s pronouns
- User’s hobbies

And this is how users should be able to interact with their own profiles:

- Create a new profile with some information
- Add hobbies
- View profile

Let’s get started!
