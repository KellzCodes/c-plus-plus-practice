# Errors

On your programming journey, you are destined to encounter innumerable red errors. Some even say, that debugging is over 75% of the development time. But what makes a programmer successful isn’t avoiding errors, it’s knowing how to find the solution.

In C++, there are many different ways of classifying errors, but they can be boil down to four categories:

- **Compile-time errors:** Errors found by the compiler.
- **Link-time errors:** Errors found by the linker when it is trying to combine object files into an executable program.
- **Run-time errors:** Errors found by checks in a running program.
- **Logic errors:** Errors found by the programmer looking for the causes of erroneous results.
