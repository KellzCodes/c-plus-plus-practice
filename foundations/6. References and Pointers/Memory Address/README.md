# Memory Address

1. Start with this code:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  
  int power = 9000;
  
  // Print power
  std::cout << power << "\n";
  
  // Print &power
  
  
}
```

2. In the above code, we have already declared and initialized a variable called ```power```.

	Print the memory address of ```power``` using ```std::cout```.

Example code can be found in the [memory.cpp](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/foundations/6.%20References%20and%20Pointers/Memory%20Address/memory.cpp) file.
