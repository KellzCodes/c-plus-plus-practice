# References

shows how to declare references

1. Start with this code:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  
  int soda = 99;
  
}
```

2. We have a variable called ```soda``` declared and initialized to ```99```.

	Declare another ```int``` variable called ```pop``` and make it a reference to ```soda```.

3. Letâ€™s add ```1``` to ```pop```.

4. Print out out ```soda``` and ```pop```.

	Are they the same?
