# Pointers

1. Start with this code:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
  
  int power = 9000;
  
  // Create pointer
  
  
  // Print ptr
  
  
}
```

2. In the above code, we have already declared and initialized a variable called ```power```.

	Create a pointer called ```ptr``` that points to the memory address of ```power```.

3. Now letâ€™s output the ```ptr``` using ```std::cout```.

Example code can be found in the [pointers.cpp](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/foundations/6.%20References%20and%20Pointers/Pointers/pointers.cpp) file
