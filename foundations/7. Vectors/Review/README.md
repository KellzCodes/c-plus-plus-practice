# Review

1. Write a program to find the sum of even numbers and the product of odd numbers in a vector.

	For example:

	Suppose we have a vector that is ```{2, 4, 3, 6, 1, 9}```.

	Then the program should output:

```
	Sum of even numbers is 12
	Product of odd numbers is 27
```

Example code can be found in the [review.cpp](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/foundations/7.%20Vectors/Review/review.cpp) file.
