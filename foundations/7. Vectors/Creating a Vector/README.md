# Creating a Vector

1. Start with this code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
   
  std::vector<double> subway_adult;
  
  // Declare another vector here:
  
    
  
}
```

2. The [Tokyo Subway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokyo_subway) has different payment options for adults and children. We have declared a ```double``` vector already named ```subway_adult```.

	Declare another ```double``` vector named ```subway_child```.

Example code can be found in the [tokyo.cpp](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/foundations/7.%20Vectors/Creating%20a%20Vector/tokyo.cpp) file.
