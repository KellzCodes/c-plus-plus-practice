# Vectors

Storing data with vectors, a sequence of elements that you can access by an index.

- []()

To do just about anything of interest in a program, we need a group of data to work with.

For example, our program might need:

- A list of Twitterâ€™s trending tags
- A set of payment options for a car
- A catalog of eBooks read over the last year

The need for storing a collection of data is endless.

We are familiar with data types like ```int``` and ```double```, but how do we store a group of ```int```s or a group of ```double```s?

In this lesson, we will start with one of the simplest, and arguably the most useful, ways of storing data in C++: a vector.

A *vector* is a sequence of elements that you can access by index.
