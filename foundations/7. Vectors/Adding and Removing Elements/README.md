# Adding and Removing Elements

1. Start with this code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  
  std::vector<std::string> last_jedi;
  
  // Add characters here:
  
  
  
  
  
  
  std::cout << last_jedi[0] << " ";
  std::cout << last_jedi[1] << " ";
  std::cout << last_jedi[2] << " ";
  std::cout << last_jedi[3] << " ";
  
}
```

2. In the above code, we have a ```std::string``` vector.

	Add these four strings using ```.push_back()```:

	- ```"kylo"```
	- ```"rey"```
	- ```"luke"```
	- ```"finn"```

Example code can be found in the [last_jedi.cpp](https://github.com/keldavis/c-plus-plus-practice/blob/master/foundations/7.%20Vectors/Adding%20and%20Removing%20Elements/last_jedi.cpp) file.
