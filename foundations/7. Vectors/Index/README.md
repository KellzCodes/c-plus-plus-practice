# Index

1. Start with this code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
   
  std::vector<double> subway_adult = {800, 1200, 1500};
  
  std::vector<double> subway_child = {400, 600, 750};
  
  // What number at index 2 of subway_child?
  
  
  
}
```

2. What is the element at index 2 in the ```subway_child``` vector?

	Find out the answer by outputting it out using ```std::cout```.
