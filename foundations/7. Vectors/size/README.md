# .size()

1. Start with this code:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  
  std::vector<std::string> grocery = {"Hot Pepper Jam", "Dragon Fruit", "Brussel Sprouts"};
    
  // Add more 
  
  
  
  
  
  
}
```

2. Add a few more items to the grocery list using ```.push_back()```.

	Print the size of ```grocery``` using ```.size()```.

	Is it the same as you expected?
