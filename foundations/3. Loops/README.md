# Loops

A loop is a programming tool that repeats some code or a set of instructions until a specified condition is reached. As a programmer, you’ll find that you rely on loops all the time! You’ll hear the generic term “iterate” when referring to loops; iterate simply means “to repeat”.

When we see that a process has to repeat multiple times in a row, we write a loop. Loops allow us to create efficient code that automates processes to make scalable, manageable programs.
